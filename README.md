# Getting started

As the Ionic package of JSONForms is currently WIP and hasn't been released yet,
we need to link it. The following steps will become less of a hassle once the 
package has been released.

1. Clone this repo. 
   We'll use `$JSONFORMS_IONIC_REPO` when we refer to the clone location of this repo. 
2. Clone the [JSONForms repo](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms]). 
   We'll use `$JSONFORMS_REPO` when we refer to the clone location of this repo.
3. Execute `npm install -g ionic`
4. Install dependencies via `npm install`
5. Execute `ionic serve`
